## About Arialshop

Arialshop is a Javascript ecommerce software that focus mainly on speed and ease of use. It is built over the cutting edge technology and purely modular code.

This is based on ReST API and disconnected architecture. Hence you are free to use any front-end or backend. For the same reason I separated both store front and store back office. Now you are free to use any ecommerce service like Moltin or even Firebase.

This has the potential to be converted to any type of ecommerce from Fashion Store, Electronics, Grocery Store with a little customizations

::: tip INFO
In simple terms I will call this Flipkart Clone. Although not as complete like the giant [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/), most of this scripts features are inspired from Flipkart resulting speed and better usability.
